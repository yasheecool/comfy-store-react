# Comfy Store

## About the Project
**Comfy Store** is a simple project built to get hands-on experience with **React Router**, specifically its **Data Mode**, which is the industry standard for building React SPAs.  

For this project, an existing API was used—no backend was manually created. This approach allowed me to focus purely on frontend development and understand the data fetching and routing concepts in isolation.
